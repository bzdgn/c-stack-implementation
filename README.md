A simple stack implementation for C

I'm on my C recap after severals years. This is a simple, primitive implementation of Stack with basic features and trivial functions.

Stack features;
***************
push
pop
printStack

Sample Output from Main.c;
**************************
Stack: 45 30 15
Popped element: 45
Popped element: 30
Popped element: 15
